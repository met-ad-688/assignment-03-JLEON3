# AI Request 1 (Model = Auto)

how do I update my code to show MAX_YEARS_EXPERIENCE with Jitter based off of the code I currently have? 

Response - To add jitter to the MAX_YEARS_EXPERIENCE axis in your scatter plot, you can add a small random value to that column before plotting. Hereâ€™s how you can update your code:

```{python}
import numpy as np

# Add jitter to MAX_YEARS_EXPERIENCE
np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
jitter_strength = 0.3  # Adjust as needed
df_pd["MAX_YEARS_EXPERIENCE_JITTER"] = df_pd["MAX_YEARS_EXPERIENCE"] + np.random.uniform(-jitter_strength, jitter_strength, size=len(df_pd))

fig1 = px.scatter(
    df_pd,
    x="MAX_YEARS_EXPERIENCE_JITTER",
    y="Average_Salary",
    color="EDU_GROUP",
    hover_data=["LOT_V6_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME"],
    title="<b>Experience vs Salary by Education Level</b>",
    opacity=0.7,
)

fig1.update_traces(marker=dict(size=7, line=dict(width=1)))
fig1.update_layout(template="nike")
fig1.show()
```

Key changes:

Created a new column MAX_YEARS_EXPERIENCE_JITTER with random noise added.
Used this new column for the x-axis in your plot.
This will visually separate overlapping points on the x-axis and make your scatter plot easier to interpret!
